    "description": "36 years after the first rotary Chantez came to fruition, the Super Chantez takes the concept of a rotary-powered kei car further than Mazda could ever imagine. Instead of the 12A rotary being used like the previous iteration, the RX-7's 13B is chosen to make a probably overkill amount of power at 280hp. Just look at this thing! The fact that someone was crazy enough to create something like this not once, but twice is mind-boggling! I think we can all agree that this is a pedestal-worthy creation.",
