    "description": "The guys behind the infamous 5000hp V16 hypercar strikes again with another outlandish creation that is the Sixty. This time, the engineering department decided to tone down a little and paired the 6x6 with a 6.7L, 700hp V8 diesel engine. Despite weighing double that of the average pickup truck, it's a menace capable of beating supercars on a drag strip.",
