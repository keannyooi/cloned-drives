    "description": "Very many pre-war cars, such as the 2 litre saloon were bodied by the company of E. Bertelli Ltd, run by Enrico ‘Harry’ Bertelli, brother of A.C. ‘Bert’ Bertelli, in a factory next door to Aston Martin in Feltham. It was initially intended that 100 of the 4 door saloon would be built on the longer 9’8”chassis together with a lesser number of 2 door tourers.",
