    "description": "After revolutionizing the way burger patties are made in fast food chains, Lou Richards wanted to start off fresh again. He had the idea of building a lightweight sports car in the spirit of the Lotus 7, and with the help of people such as Bob McKee and David Stollery of Toyota Celica design fame he created a sports trike that handled amazingly. It was only produced for 3 years before Stevens contracted health problems and had to sell the project off to Harley Davidson, who didn't continue the Trihawk's production.",
