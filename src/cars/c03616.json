    "description": "For the 2011 season, Aston Martin Racing returned to the Le Mans 24 Hour race and Le Mans Series with a new LMP1 race car designed from the ground up with an open cockpit carbon-fibre monocoque chassis and a new purpose-designed 2 litre petrol powered race engine. By the Silverstone round of the Le Mans series, the previous V12 engined Lola-Aston Martin LMP1 was again pressed into front line service. It turned out that the older car was both faster and more reliable than the newer one.",
