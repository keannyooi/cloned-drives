    "description": "One year later, Pininfarina revealed the production-ready Enjoy in conjunction with Louis Vutton, which developed the interior, custom helmets and racing suits as well as hosted the event in which it was shown. Its powerplant received a bump in horsepower from 135hp to 189hp. The then newly-acquired Matra was tasked for producing the car, however only 15 were made out of the planned 75.",
