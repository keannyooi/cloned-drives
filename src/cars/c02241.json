    "description": "Originally started as a collaboration with Lotus, the Alias shared many mechanical components with the ZAP-X SUV (based on the Lotus APX) that was being developed at the same time. Claims from ZAP at the time suggested a range of around 150 miles and a 0-60mph time of 5.7s, making it capable of beating Porsches. It was supposed to launch in 2009 with a price of USD$30,000, but a lack of funding to build a production plant in Kentucky stopped that from happening.",
