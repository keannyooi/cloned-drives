    "description": "This is possibly RE Amemiya's most well known build because it was featured in Gran Turismo, and it's for a good reason: this car can lap the Tsukuba Circuit in under a minute. If you thought that wasn't impressive enough, the car still retains many interior commodities such as air conditioning. According to Amemiya-san, the secret to such high performance lies in the boost timing of both turbochargers.",
