    "description": "Presented at the 2008 Paris Motor Show, the Hypnos has many unhinged interior design choices, such a dashboard cluster presented via light diffraction, seats that won't fool anyone into thinking that they're comfortable to sit on positioned like the helix structure of DNA and an overengineered, overdesigned clock. According to Citroen, the car can adjust its interior lighting and smell based on the driver's feelings.",
