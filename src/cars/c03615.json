    "description": "David Brown had a very soft spot for the Lagonda marque and it is because of him directly that the factory offered the Rapide Saloon alongside the much faster selling DB4 even though it got in the way of production somewhat. David Brown was also keen to expand the Lagonda range into a shooting brake and reputedly got Touring of Milan to do some sketches. But with the Rapide being such a slow seller, the potential market for a shooting brake would have been incredibly small and without doubt a commercial failure. This is chassis LR/107/R which has undergone total transformation by Carrosserie using said sketches.",
