    "description": "Nissan was playing around with their e-4ORCE powertrain made for the then soon-to-be-launched Ariya with this test mule based on the Leaf, the other EV Nissan was selling at the time. The powertrain took elements from the GT-R's torque-split system and the Patrol's 4WD system. At the time, many people wanted this technology directly on the Leaf, but alas it stayed as only a testing vehicle.",
