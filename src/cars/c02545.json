    "description": "The Blackwood, which has its name derived from the African Wenge wood used in its trunk, was an attempt by Lincoln to create a new \"luxury pickup truck\" market segment following the success of the Navigator. Turns out combining luxury with utility, which are two conflicting qualities, into a single package is a bad idea, which ultimately led to a sales disaster with just over 3000 units built and sold over the span of a single year before being discontinued. At least it now bears the novelty of the rarest Lincoln ever made.",
