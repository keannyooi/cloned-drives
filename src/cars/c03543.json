    "description": "Released alongside the Cabrio-Coupe Concept of the same company, the 4-Door Coupe Concept's design philosophy is centered around meeting their customers' desires. Although the name is rather uncreative, the car doesn't look too bad. A 1:24 model of the car was distributed at the show it was presented in (the 2008 Beijing Auto Show).",
