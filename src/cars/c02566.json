    "description": "At first glance, this car looks... alien. Unlike anything on the road. And that's what Isami Amemiya was going for when the NA Super-7 first showed up in 2012. As the name suggests, the 13B rotary engine was kept naturally aspirated, a strange move for a Japanese tuner since they love adding turbochargers to engines. With such bodywork, it's no surprise that the car won the Best Build award at the Tokyo Auto Salon.",
