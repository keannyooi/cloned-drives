    "description": "In 2016, the founder of Go Puck, the company that hold the rights for various EV-related patents such as the Tesla Supercharger system, piloted this car up Pikes Peak and broke the Electric Production Class record with a time of 11:48.264. This was the first time a Tesla won a race and broke a record there. Despite being in the Electric Production Class, this car received many race car modifications, shedding off 360kg from its original weight.",
