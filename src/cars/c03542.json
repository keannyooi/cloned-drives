    "description": "Speed is one hell of a drug, they say. After the USA's transition from an era of speed and power to an era of efficiency and lack of oil, some people just can't seem to give up on going fast. So of course someone decided to turn a fire hazard into a grenade, and that person is Jack Stratton. Together with a Ford dealership, the Pangra was conceived as a conversion kit to add some much-needed oomph to the Pinto, available in complete or partial form. Considering the reliability of these things, very few of these have survived to the 21st century.",
