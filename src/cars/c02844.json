    "description": "There seems to be a consistent law that tiny cars are often more well-received than any other size of car throughout history. This adorable little thing proves this point further as it is now the new big thing in China, where EVs are significantly easier to register than conventional ICE vehicles. Winning over the hearts of the Chinese youth, it has been selling like hot cakes all over China, becoming the best selling EV in the world that isn't the Tesla Model 3.",
