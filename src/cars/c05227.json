    "description": "Flagship Maserati sports sedan with excellent driving dynamics, appealing looks and a Ferrari derived V8, which many believe that sounds better in this car and often described as an aphrodisiac. But it is paired with one of the worst transmissions to ever exist called DuoSelect. To put it into words of how bad it is, Doug DeMuro described it like: \"It's like you're driving with a learner driver who's trying to learn stick shift.\"",
