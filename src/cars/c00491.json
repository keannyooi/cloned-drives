    "description": "The GM EV1 was a product very ahead of its time, being the only car that hit the DOE's EV America performance goals. Interestingly, people didn't own the car per se, rather they leased them from Saturn for $399 ~ 549 a month, and even then the leasing requests were pre-screened which meant many wannabe lessees couldn't have their requests fulfilled. Even worse, in 2003, GM infamously recalled all EV1's and sent most of them to the crusher.",
