    "description": "Perhaps the most unlikely group of contestants in the Progressive Automotive X Prize is this self-proclaimed \"EV Conspiracy\" from Illinois. Despite the name, it's an honest grassroots effort led by Kevin Smith, who has experience in designing envoironmentally friendly vehicles, although they did shamelessly pull many scrap parts from other cars. The team was knocked out of the competition due to a clutch failure, but entering with a low budget of $110k is already a huge achievement, not to mention the fact that the car achieved an MPGe rating higher than all of the winners years after.",
