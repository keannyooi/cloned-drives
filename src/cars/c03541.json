    "description": "CH Auto is China's first design team that tries not to copy designs from other cars, which is what all the other Chinese brands have been known to do. The Aculeus is their first solo-developed concept car, a sleek coupe that has Maserati and BMW Z4 influences while still trying to be original. The BMW X5's V8 finds itself in the hood of the car, producing 367hp and 490Nm of torque, which is actually quite believable unlike some other Chinese concepts.",
