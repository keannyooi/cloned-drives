    "description": "The Urban Concept is what Audi claims to be a completely new species of car, even though we can probably classify it as a Lotus 7 with a roof. I don't mean to shun on its design, however - it looks like the perfect car for a young person living in the city who wants to drive something exciting. It manages to be Caterham levels of light while being powered by electricity - an impressive technological feat.",
