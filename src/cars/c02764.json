    "description": "The TA-X80's name stands for Technology Advanced eXperimental, with the 80 marking the 80th anniversary of Daihatsu. Its looks may suggest something bigger powering the car but no, it's a small 1-liter V6 engine at the middle that although twin-turbocharged, didn't yield much power at 130hp. It seems like the TA-X80 was just another product of the Japanese Economic Bubble of the 80's and has since faded into onscurity, to the point that its specifications didn't appear in any of Daihatsu's subsequent history.",
