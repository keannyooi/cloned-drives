    "description": "For the 1969 Trans-Am season, AMC developed a new engine block and installed two Holley Dominator carburetors in hopes of improving their previous results. However, the SCCA found out that the new engine had not been homologated, which was a violation of the rules, and consequently AMC had to revert to the old engine. AMC were far behind their competition as a result, and ended up finishing last in the manufacturers' championship with a mere 14 points.",
