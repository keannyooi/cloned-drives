    "description": "The Lamborghini LM004 was a prototype built in 1984 as an evolution of the LM002, designed to combine off-road ruggedness with greater luxury and performance. It featured a massive 7.0-liter V12 engine, derived from Lamborghini's marine powerplants. The LM004 also introduced a more upscale interior with premium leather, wood trim, and advanced amenities, aiming to appeal to a more exclusive market. However, its increased weight and limited demand for such a high-end off-road vehicle meant it never progressed beyond the prototype stage, remaining a unique experiment in Lamborghini's history.",
