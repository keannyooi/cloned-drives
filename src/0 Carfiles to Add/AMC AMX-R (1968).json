    "description": "Manager of AMC and president of the AMC Javelin Racing Team Jim Jeffords felt that the production AMX was missing the charm it once had as a Vignale-built prototype. Therefore, he together with his friend Brooks Stevens hatched a plan, which was to obtain a number of AMXs directly from the AMC factory and modify them to incorporate the rumble seat, then sell them as the AMX-R through AMC dealerships. Jeffords was given one pre-production AMX 390, which he sent to customizer Dave Puhl in Illinois. In six weeks, Puhl had created a brand new rumble seat AMX, which would be used as a pace car for some Trans-Am races. Being happy with the result, Jeffords wanted to produce 500 AMX-Rs, however the plan was shut down due to safety regulations.",
