    "description": "The Sport model was first introduced in the 2009 Detriot Auto Show with upgrades such a more powerful hand-wound motor and adjustable dampers. MotorTrend were the first to subject it to instrumented testing and reported a faster 0-60mph time of 3.9 seconds as well as a 12.6-second quarter mile. For those wondering about the 0-60 on the card, it's an average of multiple other magazine tests.",
