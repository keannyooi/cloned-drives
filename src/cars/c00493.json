    "description": "On the 1998 Detroit Auto Show, GM revealed 4 EV1 prototypes with different kinds of powertrains installed on them. The cars were stretched to seat 4 instead of 2, an idea that GM wanted to revisit after rejecting the idea during R&D. The Fuel Cell Prototype had the same methanol-powered fuel cell system as the one found in the Mercedes-Benz NECAR 3, which consisted of a fuel processor, an expander/compressor and a fuel cell stack. This powertrain tripled the EV1's original range.",
