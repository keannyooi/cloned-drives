    "description": "The infamous Tata Nano holds the record for the cheapest car ever made, second to none. It was initially priced at 100k rupees (around USD$1k at the time of its release), leagues lower than the original Mini and Volkswagen Beetle. A study at the time projected that the Nano could expand India's automobile market by approximately 65%, all of which consisting of India's dirt-poor working class. Perhaps unsurprisingly, its extreme cost-cutting led to many problems including fire incidents and image problems, which didn't appeal to as many people as Tata had hoped.",
