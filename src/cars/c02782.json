    "description": "2009 marked the 60-year anniversary of communist China and as per communist tradition they had a huge military parade. This car, which was made for the occasion, was powered by a very interesting engine - China's first solo-developed V12 engine that would later find its way into China's luxury magnum opus some 5 years later. Pictured in this card here is Hu Jintao, the Chinese leader at the time standing in the car during the celebration.",
