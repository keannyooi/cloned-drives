    "description": "This AMC AMX was built by Tim O'Neil and features a modified 390 with some modern upgrades. The suspension and steering rack was sourced from an E36 BMW, and the original Borgwarner T-10 was replaced by a Jericho transmission. Tim's first race in his AMX was the Mount Washington Hill Climb where his best time was a 7:42.8, and he finished 7th in his class.",
