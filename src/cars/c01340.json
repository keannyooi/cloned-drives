    "description": "In 2003, Peter Wheeler's dream was finally made true. And he wasn't going to let a nobody ruin it - he personally met and vetted the buyer to make sure it was a suitable candidate. Although the original bodywork was destroyed, a shell from the GT racers was used. The W112BGH was the only copy made, and despite not fully representing the original Project 7/12, who doesn't want a track day version of it?",
