    "description": "The neora was Luxgen's first foray into making a sedan and an EV. Its design language, which would go on to become the basis of the upcoming 5 sedan's styling, was made \"to transform the cold and rigid industrial product into one of the emotional kind\", quoting the automaker. its interior adopted eco-friendliess as a design motif, featuring recycled wood trim and earthen colours for the seats.",
