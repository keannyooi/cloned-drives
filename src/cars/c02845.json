    "description": "During the 2010 North American International Auto Show, the Alias, now rehomologated as a motorcycle, had its specifications revised. It was also announced that the car would be built by a Chinese brand called Jonway for the Chinese market. At around this time, the car would also compete in the Progressive Insurance Automotive X Prize, where it ended up finishing 4th place after almost completing the final 100-mile race. Nothing about the car would surface afterwards and with the activity of ZAP becoming a mystery as of 2017, it is unknown what happened to the prototype(s) or whether the car would ever reach production.",
