    "description": "Hideki Tanabe's final creation before his departure from this world. As its namesake would suggest, this build's main focus is adding lightness to a street-legal car, which is no simple task. In addition to being based on the already exclusive 380RS, this car is further blessed by Tanabe-san with stuff like multiple lightweight dry-carbon panels, a new downforce-optimized front end, engine upgrades and, as per Amuse specialty, a custom titanium exhaust system.",
