    "description": "After the acquisition of REVA by Mahindra & Mahindra, the NXR finally became available for purchase in 2013 under a new name, 3 years off the planned production date and without all the crazy remote tech promoted back in 2009. According to the manufacturer, the delays were caused by the Indian government being indecisive on whether or not they wanted to provide tax benefits to the buyers.",
