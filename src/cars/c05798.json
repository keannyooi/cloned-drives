    "description": "Back in the 80s, German brothers Martin and Friedhelm Wiesmann got an idea of creating a roadster with the style of 50s and 60s with the modern technology, and their brainchild was born in 1993 in the form of MF25. A lightweight roadster with a funky design that divided people's opinion on whether if it's ugly or beautiful, but no matter what there's no way you're ever confusing this car with anything else on the planet.",
