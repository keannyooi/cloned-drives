    "description": "The DBR2 was a development of the unused 1955 chassis from the aborted V12 Lagonda matched with the Tadek Marek 3670cc, 6 cylinder engine that was destined to appear in the roadgoing DB4 a year later. Bigger, more powerful and faster than the similarly styled DBR1, DBR2/1 was debuted at the 1957 Le Mans 24 hour but retired after the gearbox failed after 81 laps. ",
