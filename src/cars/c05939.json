    "description": "The Lamborghini L147 Canto was a concept car unveiled in the late 1990s as a potential successor to the Diablo. Designed by Marcello Gandini, with later revisions by Lamborghini’s then-owner Audi, the Canto featured a striking and unconventional design characterized by its bold rear intakes and aerodynamic lines. However, its polarizing aesthetics and a desire for a more cohesive vision led Lamborghini to abandon the project in favor of the Murciélago, leaving the Canto as an intriguing \"what could have been\" in Lamborghini's lineage.",
