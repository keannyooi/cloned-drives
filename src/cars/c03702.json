    "description": "Is this the most attractive car of the B&M era? Well I'd like to think that this pretty Boat Tail car with 11 hp side valve engine is a real contender. According to the AM Regsiter, this car started life as a Works track racer which following a crash, donated parts to make this car. It is now owned by Aston Martin themselves and is often displayed at the factory in Gaydon.",
