    "description": "This tic-tac looking oddball is BMW's first commercial EV launched under their i subbrand, and was the culmination of BMW's experience with previous EV prototypes such as the Mini E and BMW ActiveE. Made from a variety of lightweight materials such as carbon-fiber reinforced plastic for the passenger compartment and hemp for the door panels, the i3's 22kWh battery lasts for 160km (doubled if paired with a 2-cyllinder range extender engine). Despite some people finding its looks unattractive, it enjoyed moderate success for an EV, selling out 220,000+ units over its almost decade-long production lifespan.",
