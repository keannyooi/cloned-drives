    "description": "Little is known about the AMX Von Piranha Edition, but it is a regular 390 AMX Shift-Command Go Package with a modified air intake, and air scoops on the roof and C-pillars. Also, the hood was modified with bulge sides cut open to increase the air intake. No one knows for sure who is behind the Von Piranha conversion, but it is rumoured to have been made by Thoroughbred Motors in Denver. It is estimated that 20 were made, and 19 more are left to be discovered in abandoned AMC dealerships awaiting new owners.",
