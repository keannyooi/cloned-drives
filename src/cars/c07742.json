    "description": "In 1971, the Javelin was restyled following the pony car market trend of bigger and beefier cars. The wheelbase grew 1 inch, the height was lowered, and the car was widedened allowing for a wider track, thus improving handling. The 360 was the second largest V8 engine available for the Javelin, producing 290 horespower with the four barrel carburetor. This specific car was equipped with the 3-speed column shifter Shift-Command transmission paired with a 2:87.1 rear end ratio.",
