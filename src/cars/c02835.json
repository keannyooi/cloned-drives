    "description": "After striking gold with the Laibao SRV, Shuanghuan tried capitalizing on that success with the SCEO, an unholy mashup of the Toyota Land Cruiser Prado, the BMW X3 and X5 that has since become the textbook example of early Chinese car manufacturers being unoriginal. A dispute between BMW and Shuanghuan broke out when the car planned to be shown at the 2007 Frankfurt Motor Show. After a year-long lawsuit, BMW won and the SCEO ended up being banned from Germany - a first shot to the foot for Chinese copycats.",
