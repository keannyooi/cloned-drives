    "description": "Perhaps the sexiest Lotus to ever exist, just look at that rollcage. It wasn't really a street-legal car, so in order to get around of that, you were buying a normal S1 Elise and giving it to Lotus Special Vehicle Operations to convert it into Sport 190 trim. Perhaps the most hardcore S1 Elise to be made from factory.",
