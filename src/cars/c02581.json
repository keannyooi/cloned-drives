    "description": "Environmental sustainability back then was viewed as lame, however there were a few attempts in busting that myth. Meet the Volvo 3CC, a sleek electric coupe with 3-seat layout, an uncommon sight in cars, with a driver seat at the front and 2 passenger seats at the back in tandem. It's so light Volvo didn't see the need to give it ABS and runs on supercar tyres, which I personally think is kinda pushing it.",
