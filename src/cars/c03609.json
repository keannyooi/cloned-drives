    "description": "Initially you may think that this is just ‘another’ DB4GT! Not so. In 1990, the factory decided that it might be a good idea to purchase and restore a DB4 in order to test out new ideas that could be incorporated into customers cars. UAW 707, an early DB4 in poor condition was given the designation - DP2155, then the car was extensively modified by Works Service. UAW 707 has become probably, the most developed DB4 in existence.",
