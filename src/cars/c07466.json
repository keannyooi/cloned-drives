    "description": "The ninth chassis was originally supposed to be a spyder version of the AMX/3 until the project was abandoned by AMC. It was later sold to Giordanengo along with the seventh car, who finished the car and equipped it with a Chevy 327. The car was also sold to D'Ieteren in 1992, who gave it an AMC heart, a 390 AMC V8. He also opted for a ZF 5-speed transaxle, like the one found in the original prototype. Like the seventh car, the AMX/3 Spyder is also displayed at Autoworld in Belgium.",
