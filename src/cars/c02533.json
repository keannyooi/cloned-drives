    "description": "The Emme was definitely more upper-class than most other Brazillian-made cars at the time, but for some reason it didn't come with airbags and ABS, which instantly added 30 years to the car's technological age. People also found uncanny levels of similarity on its design (according to Megastar it had been developed in-house for a decade) to the Volvo ECC concept. These unwelcome discoveries led people to doubt the sustainability of the project. This was reflected most clearly in its sales, where only 15 of the projected 50 units per month were made *ever*.",
