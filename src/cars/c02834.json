    "description": "Funnily enough, even the Chinese press thought the car was too much of a copycat when it was released. Does being a BMW clone guarantee BMW levels of quality? Absolutely not! Wolfgang Blaube of Autobild got a 5-year-old SCEO out of curiousity and found out that the car had aged more in 5 years than most cars on the road do in 20. He hated it so much he blew it up in Jeremy Clarkson fashion after testing.",
