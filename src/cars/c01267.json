    "description": "The Electric GT Championship was later renamed to the Electric Production Car Series (EPCS) and it was set to start hosting inaugural seasons from 2018 onwards. However, a lack of investors, the overheating Model S's batteries causing Tesla's software to cap the racecar's power output and lack of assistance from Tesla caused the series to flop. The series since became a fad of a time when EVs were shiny new hypebringers.",
