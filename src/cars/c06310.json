    "description": "The LM002 Successor that never was. During the ownership of Lamborghini by megatech, a study to make a follow up for the countach engined suv went underway as it was a steady low volume seller, the result was this fullscale model designed by SZ Design, a UK based company, but it didn't progress beyond this, after market research it was concluded that it wouldn't attract Lamborghini buyers and the market segment it was aiming for was almost empty with only the Range Rover as its representative, therefore it wasn't worth the investment and so the project was promptly canned",
