    "description": "The first AMX/3 started its life in Livorno in March 1969 where Diomante would begin assembling the car. However, Diomante did not finish the car, and it was later sent to BMW in June 1969 for test drives and chassis testing. There it was found that the chassis was so weak that it deformed under hard acceleration and braking. Additionally, the 390 V8 suffered from insufficient cooling, and as a result the car would return to Italy, where the chassis and cooling was revised by Bizzarrini and Giugiaro. The first car was only good for 145 mph because it had too much lift, and at high speeds, it raised the front of the car. This is also the only AMX/3 fitted with a 5-speed ZF Transaxle, unlike the other cars which have a special 4-speed gearbox made by OTO Melara.",
