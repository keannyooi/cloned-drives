    "description": "Mugen and Honda ran a single make racing series using the City Turbos. The motors had larger exhaust, injectors, production turbo and intercooler, and a modified camshaft to produce 138hp. The cars from the one make racing series were bought by an Australian entrepreneur with the vision for continuing the series in Australia. Unfortunately all the vehicles were in a warehouse in Osaka waiting to be shipped when the Great Hanshin earthquake of 1995 struck and buried the lot.
