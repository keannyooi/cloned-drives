    "description": "The Lancer Evolution series that had continued through the Evo I, II, and III took a major leap forward in May 1996. With the full model change of the base Lancer sedan, the true second generation of the Evo series, the Lancer Evolution IV was born. The most significant change was the introduction of the electronically controlled AYC (Active Yaw Control), which now replaced the mechanical LSD in the rear differential of previous models.",
