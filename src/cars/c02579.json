    "description": "Made by famed Toyota tuner TOM'S as a 20th anniversary celebration, the Angel T01 is considered the holy grail of Japan's obsession with tiny cars. It was a mid-engined, lightweight sports car with Toyota parts assembled in the UK... wait that's literally the Lotus Exige. Not that it matters anyway, because this is the only T01 in existence, and I'm pleased to say that it's still running strong today!",
