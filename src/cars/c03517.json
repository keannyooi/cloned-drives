    "description": "Chevrolet decided to bring back the legendary Impala name with this big stealthy muscle car. It was based on the Caprice and had a 5.7 liter V8 under the hood and in fact that engine was small for the car and Chevrolet put 8.2 liter V8 into the pre-production prototype. Also for its first year this car was only offered with black paint which added more to its stealthiness.",
