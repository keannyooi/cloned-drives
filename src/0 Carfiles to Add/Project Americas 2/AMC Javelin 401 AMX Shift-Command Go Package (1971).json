    "description": "The AMX Package was the highest trim for the 2nd gen Javelin, and when paired with the Go Package, it had superb handling for its time. The Javelin AMX was as close as you'd get to driving a Trans-Am car on the road, and it even shared the spoiler used on the Trans-Am Javelins which produced 45.4 kg of downforce. The car was no faster than a regular 401-equipped Javelin in a straight line though.",
