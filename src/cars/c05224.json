    "description": "There was a time when Maserati was owned by Citroen, and this rather bizarre generation of Quattroporte is a creation of that partnership. It is based on the Citroen SM platform, which had a front wheel drive platform, making this the only front wheel drive Maserati ever. It also uses the V6 from the Citroen SM making around 250 horsepower. And even though this is technically a production car, throughout the 2 year production line they only made 12 of them, wtf.",
