    "description": "The 2009 Frankfurt Motor Show saw REVA showcasing 2 prototypes that were set to release in the near future, namely the NXR and NXG. The NXG wanted to challenge the lame reputation REVA had gained through the G-Whiz by presenting itself as a sporty, chic roadster. Designed by fellow Indian design firm DC Design, it was set to be released in 2011, but nothing like it has made to production since then.",
