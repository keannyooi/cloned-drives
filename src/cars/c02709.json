    "description": "The H2 Speed is the world's most recognisable hydrogen race car described by Italdesign as \"halfway between a racing prototype and a production supercar\". The majority of its design is a throwback to the Ferrari Sigma concept car, from the giant hood decal nomenclating the car to the striking rear wing design. In case any doubters are reading this, high-power hydrogen propulsion technology is precisely the research topic of GreenGT, Pininfarina's collaboration partner for this concept.",
