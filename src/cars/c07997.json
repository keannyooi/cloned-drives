    "description": "The eighth AMX/3 chassis was used as the platform for the Iso Rivolta Varedo, and according to Bizzarrini this was why it could turn such good lap times at Monza. The car was assembled by Bizzarini, and used some 5300 GT components for weight reduction. Bizzarrini also swapped out the AMC V8 for the 351 Cleveland found in the Iso Lele. It was presented in 1972 at the Turin Motor Show with an unfinished interior, and thus the windows were tinted.",
