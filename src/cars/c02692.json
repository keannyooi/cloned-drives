    "description": "After experiencing a massive earthquake in 2011, a Japanese man by the name of Hideo Tsurumaki started designing a mini vehicle that could double as a boat when the roads are flooded. He ended up creating the Concept One, a car designed to allow people to escort to safety in case of a flood or a tsunami. The front wheels, along with their tyres, propel the car both on land and on water through a 5kW in-wheel motor in each wheel.",
