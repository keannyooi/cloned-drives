    "description": "The bumpers were once again redesigned, but kept the same bumper guards. Front disc brakes were standard on all 1974 Javelins and radial tires became optional. 1974 would be the final year for the Javelin because of the changes in the pony car market. Chrysler stopped making pony cars, and Ford among other manufacturers replaced their old pony cars with smaller engined cars due to the 1973 oil crisis, as well as a decline in the interest for high-performance cars. Another contributing factor to the Javelin's demise was the fact that AMC would have to put about $12 million into the engineering and design department to revise the bumpers to meet the 1975 standards.",
