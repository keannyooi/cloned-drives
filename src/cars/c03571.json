    "description": "This is about as extreme as a car can get unhindered by race or road restrictions. AML were suggesting the combined output of the 6.5 litre Cosworth V12 combined with a KERS style energy recovery system will result in a combined power output of more than 1100bhp and with a target weight of under 1000 kg,  a figure than comfortably exceeds the magic 1:1 power-to-weight ratio. It will also be capable of generating more than its own weight in downforce to give eventual equivalent performance of a F1 or LMP1 sports car.",
