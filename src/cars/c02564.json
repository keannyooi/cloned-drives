    "description": "Mazda, being the loyal rotary fanboys they were (and still are to an extent), originally wanted their Chantez kei car to sport a rotary engine, but that was too big of a hack in the eyes of their competitors so they had to give up on that idea. Fast forward to 1980 and a certain Amemiya-san made Mazda's rotary kei car dreams come true and proceeded to terrorize the Wangan with it.",
