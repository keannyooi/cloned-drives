    "description": "Rally driver Tanner Foust teamed up wth Weistec to break the record for the fastest street-legal minivan in one of these (although not the exact vehicle depicted here) in 2020. He reached 165.5mph with it on a closed road in Nebraska, although with 700hp one may suspect that the Merc's true potential is limited by its gearbox. Interestingly, AMG also claimed the same figure for the stock R 63 equipped with their Driver's Package option, which deletes the speed limiter.",
