    "description": "One small step for man, one giant leap for mankind. The Lunar Roving Vehicle (LRV) was used for NASA's Apollo 15, 16, and 17 missions allowing for efficient transport of astronauts and equipment across the Moon's surface. It was an important technological achievement to help expand our understanding of the Moon. All three mission used Lunar Rovers still reside on the moon today. It also holds the undefeated Lunar speed record.",
