    "description": "Nology thought America needed a luxury performance sedan and wanted to fulfill that. Their car of choice? A Lincoln LS V8. As a 2000's tuning project, this Lincoln received the kinds of goodies you'd expect to find in Need for Speed Most Wanted (the 2005 one) such as nitrous, ground effect aero parts and period-correct rims. For whatever reason they didn't bother swapping the automatic transmission to a manual.",
