    "description": "Of the 5 RS450s made by Ralliart UK only one was based on an Evo V, the rest were based on Evo VIs. This is the most 'eXtreme' Evo V money could buy... except you could not buy it as it was a test and press car for the Evo VI upgrade. Why was it named the RS450? That was the torque figure they aimed for but never achieved.",
