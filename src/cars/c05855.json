    "description": "Surrounded by a swarm of Porsche backdates and restomods at The Quail, A Motorsports Gathering during Monterey Car Week in 2024, Ruf Automobile’s Rodeo turned heads thanks to a lifted ride height, fender flares, bright orange paint and a western-themed interior. The official debut of the model year 2025 Rodeo took place more than four years after Covid-19 scuttled original plans to show the car in 2020, and when the barking twin-turbo flat-six fired up for a few revs to satisfy the crowd, this uniquely Americana-inspired Ruf seemed well worth the wait.",
