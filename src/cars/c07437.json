    "description": "The AMX was marketed as the only American sports car that costs less than $3500, and was a market niche at the time which attracted youngsters into AMC dealers. All AMXs were equipped with a four-barrel carburetor and the AMC small block V8. The 290 is the base model engine, and it has small intake and exhaust valves, thin block webbing, and a cast nodular iron crankshaft, making it different from the 343 and 390 mechanically. Despite this, the engine is good for 225 horsepower at the crank, which is impressive for a base model nontheless.",
