    "description": "A 1968 AMC Javelin imported to Sweden in 2011 turned into a Trans-Am tribute race car, celebrating Mark Donohue's and Penske Trans-Am success. The stunning bodywork was done by Zetterman Engineering, and it packs a 304 AMC V8 refined for racing by Lars Palmkvist. The Borgwarner T-10 4-speed transmission was kept from the stock car and made race-ready by TS Motorsport, who were also responsible for building the chassis.",
