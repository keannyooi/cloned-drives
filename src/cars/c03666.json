    "description": "AMR1/4 was the first and only AMR1 to be offered for sale at auction. Chassis 4 was arguably the most successful example gaining a 4th in the Brands Hatch 480km, 8th in the Nurburgring 480km and 6th in the Donnington 480km. In the Brooks/AML auction, May 2000, the car found a new owner and is now part of a collection of AM race cars in the USA.",
