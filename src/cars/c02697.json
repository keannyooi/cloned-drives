    "description": "Based on Suzuki's very own one-make race car, the Hayabusa Sport Concept was billed as \"the ultimate lightweight sports car\" in its 2002 Tokyo Auto Salon debut. Its namesake comes from its engine, which is the same as the one that propels the fastest production motorcycle in the world at that time. This concept sounded like a swole idea, but Suzuki never planned on producing it, to the extent of leaving the car mechanically unfinished after the reveal.",
