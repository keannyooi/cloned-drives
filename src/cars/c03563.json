    "description": "The other concept car revealed alongside the Hongqi S9 is what would eventually become Hongqi's top-of-the-line luxury SUV. The reason it bears quite a resemblance to the Rolls-Royce Cullinan is quite simple: it was designed by none other than the man who designed the Cullinan himself, Giles Taylor. Hongqi only claimed a 600km driving range and Level 4 self-driving technology for it at the show.",
