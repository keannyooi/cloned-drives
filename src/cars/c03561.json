    "description": "Dahlan Iskan is a somewhat controversial figure in Indonesian politics known for solving problems in the most unorthodox of ways as well as his unwavering determination to develop the nation's very own EV. The Tucuxi, named after a type of freshwater dolphin, was among the first of his EV forays. If anyone's wondering who on Earth designed this godawful-looking thing, you can thank Danet Suryatama (who owns ElektrikCar) for that. /s",
