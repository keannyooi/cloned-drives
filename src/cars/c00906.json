    "description": "To promote the i-MiEV and test the capabilities of EV technology, Mitsubishi decided to participate in the 2012 Pikes Peak International Hill Climb. For the event, they took 3 of the i-MiEV's motors, retuned them to max out at 11,000rpm and stuck 1 on the front and 2 on the back of a wide AF i-MiEV body. The resulting 322hp car, piloted by Hiroshi Masuoka, would go on and place 2nd in the EV class, with first place being a whole 15 seconds ahead.",
