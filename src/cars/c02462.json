    "description": "The car, aptly named \"The Devil\", has probably the most cursed engine in the world. The person who worked on it disappeared in 1983 and was assumed to have died in a plane crash while the car's owner was believed to be killed in a car crash while driving it a year before. Legend has it that the engine was salvaged and swapped into another car after the crash and that car is still on the roads of Japan to this very day. Also someone's trying to slack off by not typing the whole description...",
