    "description": "Audi decided to bring back the electric R8 project. Final revisions were made for the production and in that final form car produced 450 horsepower and 920 Nm of torque and had a range of 450 km's which is a pretty respectable figure for its time. However when this was happening the 1st generation R8 was going out of production, so this car served purpose as a test bed for the electric R8 that was going to be based on the next generation, which it did in the same year.",
