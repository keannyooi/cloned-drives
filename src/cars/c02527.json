    "description": "China is an elusive market full of people willing to throw their money at anything and everything showoff-y, especially on those huge luxury cars that are slowing fading away from the rest of the world. Citroen knows this, so to celebrate their DS sub-brand's expansion of operations into China, they created the Numero 9, a car that will make anyone, even unsuspecting fairies from another pocket dimension, lust over its elegant design.",
