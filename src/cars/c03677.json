    "description": "Hongqi stopped producing minibuses after the 1980's, but the company had toyed around with the possibility of a return to that business numerous times in the following years. The L6 is the most notable example, it's a VIP minibus presumably based on the Toyota Coaster that took over 4 years to develop. Its design is a modern take on the afforementioned minibuses' look and unlike the old minibuses, it ran on diesel fuel.",
