    "description": "As Flavio Manzoni, its designer, said during the press release, it was inspired by the combination of a spaceship with a Ferrari. We can definitely say that's true, as it now holds the record for the fastest production car, achieving Chiron-levels of speed on a quarter mile, honouring its homonymous F1 car's ground-breaking speed and road-holding abilities which pushes the limit even further, only just inferior to race cars. All of this for 'just' 500.000$.",
