    "description": "The original Tesla performance sedan, which is nothing compared to the performance models offered a few years later. Some guy called Jason Hughes managed to give his P85 a 90kWh battery pack and hack it to activate Ludicrous Mode, upgrading the power output to 589hp, so maybe you can try doing that if you don't want to buy a new Tesla yet keep up with the later models.",
