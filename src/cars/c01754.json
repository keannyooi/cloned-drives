    "description": "Plug In Adventures, a group of EV advocates hailing from the UK, had a crazy plan to spread the EV gospel in the works for years. With backing from Nissan themselves, they entered this modified Nissan Leaf into the 2017 Mongol Rally, a 10,000-mile charity trip to Mongolia which never had EV participants. To the delight of the group, it successfully made the trip and made a statement about how EVs are capable of long-distance travel too.",
