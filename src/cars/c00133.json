    "description": "The 147 GTA in stock form is already a peppy little boi, but the blokes at Autodelta thought that wasn't enough. So they bored the GTA's engine to 3.7L and ended up with a 328hp machine that probably produces more power than it should. The car became notable for its appearance on Top Gear, where it was described as \"the hottest hatch ever\".",
