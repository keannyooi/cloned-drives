    "description": "The Volvo ECC (Environmental Concept Car) was a design exercise in using recycled material and hybrid technology, which in the ECC's case was a gas turbine-powered generator powering electric motors. It was the debut of a design language that foreshadowed what future Volvos would look like, especially the S80. The driver can enable 2 power modes with the flick of a switch - gas turbine electric mode, which does 0-60mph in 23s and hybrid mode, which is what the car is locked to by default in Cloned Drives.",
