    "description": "This gigantic freak of engineering is the brainchild of a member of the royal family of the UAE. Originally an Oshkosh M1075 military vehicle, it has been frankensteined together with parts from many sources such as a Jeep Wrangler as the driver compartment. Now I'm sure many will look at this thing in disgust, but this was conceived for the sole purpose of being nothing like anyone have ever seen before, and it sure as hell succeeded.",
