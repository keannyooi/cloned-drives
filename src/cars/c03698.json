    "description": "After the decision to reduce the number of 2 litre saloons to be built from 100 to just 50 was made, Gordon Sutherland had to introduce a revised model to take up the production capacity. So a short chassis (8' 6'') was introduced with the standard wet sump engine with the intention that the cars were to be more sporty than the 2 litre saloon and tourers built on the long chassis but not out-and-out sportscars as such.",
