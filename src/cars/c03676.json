    "description": "Behold, the pinnacle of Chinese luxury! Sporting a throwback look from the early days of Hongqi, the L5 is the antithesis to the stereotype that Chinese cars are low-quality ripoffs. In fact, the L5 is meticulously crafted with amendities comparable to a Rolls-Royce, and its asking price of 5 million yuan (USD$760,000) cements its placce as the most expensive Chinese car ever made. Even its length is deliberately set to 5,555mm to bring in all the good fortune!",
