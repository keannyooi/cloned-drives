    "description": "The CCR-1 held the title of the first Korean-made car that featured doors that open upward. It took 3 years to develop and, like the brand's avantgarde status back then, was technologically more advanced than the primitive EVs that were on the road. It was powered by a 50hp multi-phase bipolar brushless DC motor and the car's parts were recyclable.",
