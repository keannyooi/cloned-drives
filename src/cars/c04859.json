    "description": "This card is winnable from the Indycar Surprise Bonus event! For its third and final season contesting IndyCar in 1990, Porsche Motorsport commissioned a brand-new chassis from March Engineering, which was explicitly built to accept the latest 161 cid turbocharged Porsche V-8. Porsche also increased its lineup to two cars, one driven by Teo Fabi, and the other driven by John Andretti.",
