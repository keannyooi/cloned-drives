    "description": "Citroen has been in the car business for 100 years since 1919, so of course they celebrated such a huge milestone with... a living room on wheels? Of course, those are all the rage these days. You may think that the comically large wheels would make the ride feel weird, but they've more than made up for that with sponges for tyres.",
