    "description": "Even with all the controversy surrounding the car, the SCEO enjoyed moderate success outside its home country. It was exported to 70 countries and international sales made up most of the SCEO's profits. It even received 2 minor facelifts in 2008 and 2010 respectively. After the discontinuation of the Noble in 2012, the SCEO became the manufacturer's final product before it was ordered to shut down on 29 February 2016 for failing government-mandated product evaluations for 2 consecutive years.",
