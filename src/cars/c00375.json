    "description": "The ev'ie was a Citroen C1 that some fellows at Flitwick chucked lithium batteries into, locked the gearbox into 3rd gear and sold for Â£19860 from 2009 to 2011. This was a time when the only other options available included the infamously unattractive G-Whiz, so it was fairly well received by some journalists. After ECC dissolved in 2012, ev-support.co.uk took up the responsibility of keeping these cars on the road.",
