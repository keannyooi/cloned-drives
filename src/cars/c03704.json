    "description": "Although the company of Bamford and Martin had been in existence since 1913, production cars did not finally appear until 10 years later in 1923 from the factory in Abingdon Road, Kensington. One of the first cars was this wonderful Cloverleaf side valve Aston-Martin, chassis number 1926, it even entered it in the 1924 Aston Hill Climb in May, the very venue that gave its name to the marque.",
