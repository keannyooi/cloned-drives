    "description": "MZR Roadsports is a Bratford-based restomod startup named after its 2 founders (Martin Ryland the engineering guy and Rahail Tariq the designer guy) and the fact that they specialize in the oldest Nissan Z cars. The Sport Design encompasses all of what you can expect from them - an old-school sports car with a beautifully-finished engine bay and interior. The company instantly became popular online, with Evo and Top Gear being the biggest platforms to report on them and their products.",
