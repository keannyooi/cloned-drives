    "description": "This 1960 car is very special as it is one of only a very few lightweight GT’s; this one was a factory demonstration and experimental car. This car is fitted with a Zagato specification engine claimed to give 314bhp. Despite their tremendous rarity and value, the GT is still a popular race car at major historic racing events such as the Coys and Bonham’s festivals, Goodwood Revival, Classic Le Mans and occasionally at AMOC events throughout the season.",
