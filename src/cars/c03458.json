    "description": "Twin of the Isuzu Trooper, was sold on the US until 2001. The first entry on the SUV market didn't go well for Acura, since these models had a tendacy to roll over and thus consumer reviews went down. Isuzu tried to plead a defamation case, didn't work out either. Sales were poor and the reputation quickly vanished, being later replaced by the MDX.",
