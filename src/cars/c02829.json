    "description": "Ruf hoped to mass produce the eRuf Model A in 2009, however that didn't happen and they instead conceived an updated rendition of it called the Greenster during the Geneva Motor Show. This time they got Siemens to develop its drivetrain, which is more powerful than the last eRuf iteration. Ruf had plans on a limited production run of the Greenster with 2 motors instead of 1, but we haven't heard anything about this from them since then.",
