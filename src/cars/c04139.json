    "description": "The Ferrari that you’re looking at isn’t a concept. Nor is it a production car. It is a completely one-off commission. A track-focused yet elegant state-of-the-art supercar born from the penmanship of Ferrari’s Centro Stile, led by Flavio Manzoni, and one very imaginative, passionate and exacting customer.",
