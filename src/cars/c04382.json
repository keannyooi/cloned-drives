    "description": "Diesel with 12 cylinders sounds ridiculous. That diesel with 12 cylinders in a supercar sounds even more ridiculous, but this is what that is. After dominating the Le Mans with this engine Audi decided to put it into production with the R8. The engine produced 500 horsepower and a whopping 1000 Nm of torque which allowed car to easily pull off with just a tiny touch to throttle. They were serious about this but unfortunately car needed so many modifications and re-engineering to fit this engine. The Diesel R8 was cancelled, instead they put this engine into production with the Q7. Fun fact: this concept uses an Audi A4 gearbox which obviously wasn't designed to handle that much power and torque which made it hard for magazines to test drive it.",
