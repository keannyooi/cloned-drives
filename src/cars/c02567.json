    "description": "This is a Super GT car for the road. Completed with a custom ORC livery, this RX-7 is wearing an almost identical bodykit to the 2002 GT300 RX-7s down to the the wing. The 380hp rotary engine strikes a good balance between maintaining a racing character and meeting road vehicle regulations. Since this is meant for daily driving, the interior is a stark contrast to the spartan exterior, featuring lots of purple on the dashboard and even an expensive sound system.",
